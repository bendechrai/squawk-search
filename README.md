Creating noise-as-a-service, as an act of civil disobedience, that attacks the ability to profile at-risk groups through search histories.

## Purpose

When people search for "how do I contact the guardian anonymously", or "gay support services in Nigeria", they might be inadvertently putting themselves at risk.

_Squawk: Search History Noisifier_ adds noise to Google search, to make it harder to discern between real searchers (the signal) and the rest (the noise). This will, perhaps, offer some protection, by giving themplausible deniability.

## Things we want to do

*   Add more search strings
*   Alter search strings dynamically, to reduce detectability of the noise
